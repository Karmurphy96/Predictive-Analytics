# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates predictive analytics and machine learning techniques using Python to predict Bitcoin prices. It applies Random Forest, Regression, and KNN models on cryptocurrency datasets to evaluate prediction performance.
## Learning Outcomes
- Explore and preprocess cryptocurrency price datasets.
- Perform feature selection using filter, wrapper, and embedded methods.
- Implement and compare Random Forest, Regression, and KNN models.
- Evaluate models using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and visualize results.

## Dataset
The project uses the cryptocurrency dataset available [here](https://github.com/usmanakhtar/Cryptocurrency-Dataset/).

## Project Structure
'Predictive 1/` : Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karmurphy96/Predictive-Analytics.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd Predictive-Analytics/Predictive 1
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
  jupyter notebook Predictive_Analytics_Assignment.ipynb

## Future Work
- Incorporate advanced feature engineering or deep learning models.
- Integrate market sentiment analysis for improved prediction accuracy
